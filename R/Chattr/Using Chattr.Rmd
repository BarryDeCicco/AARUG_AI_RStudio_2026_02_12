## Chattr

This is a demonstration of Chattr using OpenAI (chatGPT) and Anthropic (ClaudeAI) models to interact with R.

```{r setup, include-TRUE}

# install.packages("ellmer")
library(ellmer)
```

## Trying ChatGPT from Open AI:


```{r ellmer_chatGPT, include-TRUE}

chat <- chat_openai(model = "gpt-4o")

chat <- chat_anthropic()
chat$chat("Hello from ellmer!")
